#### Problem Statement: Design and build a system that aims at evaluating the quality of education provided by a university to the students through the use of software engineering techniques. The application metricises feedbacks obtained from alumni and students over a span of 5 years and determines the quality of education delivered to the students. 

#### Our proposed solution focuses on building a performance evaluation dashboard that takes into account all alumni and student feedbacks in order to use to them as metrics for the quality of education that a university is providing the students. With such insights, many new students will be able to have a better idea about the course work and university ranking.
